            PCI DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, was
            created to offer customers using credit and debit cards for payment
            with the highest level of trust and security. These security standards
            apply to all companies that process, store or transmit card and
            related customer information. Bell is committed to maintaining our
            industries highest standards of PCI DSS Compliance.

            According to Visa®, during the last two years, more than 80% of all
            known cases of identity theft occur in smaller businesses. As a
            result, major credit card companies came together to develop the
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for merchants.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">
            PCI DSS provides four levels of merchant classifications. For example
            many of our merchants are Level 4 Merchants. A Level 4 Merchant is a
            merchant that processes less than 1MM of either Visa® or MasterCard®
            transactions or processes less than 20,000 Visa® or MasterCard®
            ecommerce transactions.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">
            The Payment Card Industry mandates that all merchants must be
            certified under these Data Security Standards. However, many companies
            have found implementing PCI DSS requirements confusing. As a result,
            many companies do not yet meet PCI DSS requirements, and face
            regulatory fines as well as potentially crippling losses of customer
            data – and customer trust.
          </div>
          <div class="fs-5 fw-500">Bell has made the certification process simple with an
              easy-to-understand questionnaire which guides you through the
              process.
