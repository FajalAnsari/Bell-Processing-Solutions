        <p>
          Security and Protection is always an issue to merchants and business
          owners. As a result of increased credit card fraud,<br />
          the Security Standards Council has made PCI compliance manatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          PCI compliance is the standards created to obstruct and prevent
          further theft of personal information at the merchant level. The PCI
          compliance requirements are strictly enforced by the payment card
          brands including Visa and MasterCard. All merchants who transmit,
          store, or process credit card information or transactions must comply.
        </p>

            >Security Check 1: Build and Maintain a Secure Network
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Bell PCI has a firewall and router system to protect cardholder
          information. Firewall performs tests when configuration changes,
          identifies all connections to cardholder information and reviews
          configuration rules ever 6 months. Firewall prohibits unauthorized
          access from networks and hosts and deny direct public access to any
          information about the cardholder.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Security Check 2: Protect Cardholder Data </strong></p>
        <p>
          Cardholder data is secure in a cryptographic form. All information is
          encrypted when transmitting the data across public networks to prevent
          criminals from stealing the personal information during the process.
          We limit the accessibility of cardholder information by installing
          passwords and other security measurements to limit access to
          cardholder data. The physical access to Cardholder data is Monitored
          and restricted. All out-dated cardholder information is destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Security Check 3: Regularly Monitor and Test Networks
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Bell PCI keeps system activity logs that trace all activity and review
          daily. Internal and external networks are scanned to identify any
          possible vulnerable areas in the system. Additionally, Bell ensures
          that all IDS/IPS engines are up to date. Anti-virus software is
          present on all computers associated on the network. In addition to
          anti-virus software, security patches are installed on each computer
          to avoid exposing cardholder data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Security Check 4: Maintain an Information Security Policy
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Bell has an established security policy which covers all PCI DSS
          compliance requirements and includes annual procedures to recognize
          any security breaches and day-to-day security policies. Bell performs
          background checks on potential employees and educate new and current
          employees about the new compliance regulations.<br />

          In today's economy, merchants are required to thoroughly evaluate
          operating costs & processing fees, all while having to operate and run
          a business. By having Bell PCI set up ad monitor security standards
          and protection clauses, companies and merchants of all sizes will save
          time and money.
