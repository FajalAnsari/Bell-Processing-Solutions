              Security and Protection is always an issue to merchants and business
          owners. As a result of increased credit card fraud,<br />
          the Security Standards Council has made PCI compliance manatory.

            <div class="mb-3">
              PCI compliance is the standards created to obstruct and prevent
          further theft of personal information at the merchant level. The PCI
          compliance requirements are strictly enforced by the payment card
          brands including Visa and MasterCard. All merchants who transmit,
          store, or process credit card information or transactions must comply.

              Bell PCI has a firewall and router system to protect cardholder
          information. Firewall performs tests when configuration changes,
          identifies all connections to cardholder information and reviews
          configuration rules ever 6 months. Firewall prohibits unauthorized
          access from networks and hosts and deny direct public access to any
          information about the cardholder.

            <div class="mb-3 ps-4">Cardholder data is secure in a cryptographic form. All information is
              encrypted when transmitting the data across public networks to prevent
              criminals from stealing the personal information during the process.
              We limit the accessibility of cardholder information by installing
              passwords and other security measurements to limit access to
              cardholder data. The physical access to Cardholder data is Monitored
              and restricted. All out-dated cardholder information is destroyed.

              Bell PCI keeps system activity logs that trace all activity and review

          that all IDS/IPS engines are up to date. Anti-virus software is
          present on all computers associated on the network. In addition to
          anti-virus software, security patches are installed on each computer
          to avoid exposing cardholder data.
